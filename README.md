# avi-scheduler
A basic react app meant for loading local html files created by Avimark® to render a table displaying all appointments and subsequent details in the web browser.

## How to Use
Open a file dialog by clicking the open file button. Select a .html file that has been created from the Avimark® schedule. When a file has been selected, click the load button load the parsed data onto the table.

The patient name, appointment time, and appointment description are received from the file and placed in the columns as shown. The resulting table can be pasted into a Google Docs table while maintaining table cell partitioning.
The cells for which the value defaults to "_" represent variable values for the Google Doc and serve just just to populate a column.
